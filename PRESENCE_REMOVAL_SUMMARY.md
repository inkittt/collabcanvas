# User Presence Feature Removal Summary

## Overview
All user presence features have been successfully removed from the CollabCanvas application. This includes presence tracking, user status indicators, room management, and related UI components.

## Files Removed

### Service Files
- `src/services/presenceService.js` - Complete presence service with room management, heartbeat, and realtime subscriptions

### UI Components
- `src/components/Canvas/CanvasPresence.js` - Presence display component showing active users, connection status, and room information

### Database Files
- `docs/sql/presence_functions.sql` - Database functions for presence management (join_canvas_room, leave_canvas_room, etc.)
- `docs/sql/migrate_presence_to_collaborators.sql` - Migration script for consolidating presence into collaborators table

### Documentation Files
- `PRESENCE_CONSOLIDATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for consolidating presence features
- `test-presence.html` - Test page for presence functionality

## Files Modified

### Database Schema
- `docs/sql/init_canvases.sql`
  - Removed presence-related fields from `canvas_collaborators` table:
    - `status` (active/idle/offline)
    - `last_seen` (timestamp)
    - `cursor_position` (JSONB)
    - `user_color` (text)
  - Removed presence-related indexes:
    - `idx_canvas_collaborators_status`
    - `idx_canvas_collaborators_last_seen`

### React Components
- `src/components/Canvas/CanvasEditor.js`
  - Removed import of `presenceService` and `CanvasPresence`
  - Removed presence-related state variables:
    - `presenceUsers`
    - `roomJoined`
    - `presenceConnected`
  - Removed presence initialization useEffect
  - Removed CanvasPresence component usage
  - Removed periodic presence refresh logic

- `src/components/Examples/RealtimeDemo.js`
  - Removed import of `trackPresence` from realtime service
  - Removed `activeUsers` state and related functionality
  - Removed presence change handlers
  - Removed `renderActiveUsers` function
  - Removed active users display from UI

### Service Files
- `src/lib/realtime.js`
  - Removed `trackPresence` function
  - Removed `updateCursorPosition` function
  - Kept only element subscription and chat functionality

## Database Migration Created

### Migration Script
- `docs/sql/remove_presence_features.sql`
  - Drops all presence-related database functions
  - Removes presence-related indexes
  - Removes presence-related columns from canvas_collaborators table
  - Includes optional steps for updating realtime publication

## What Remains

### Preserved Functionality
- Canvas collaboration (element synchronization)
- Chat functionality
- User authentication
- Canvas management
- Element creation, editing, and deletion
- Real-time element updates

### Preserved Database Tables
- `canvases` - Canvas metadata
- `elements` - Canvas elements with real-time sync
- `canvas_collaborators` - Basic collaborator permissions (without presence fields)
- `profiles` - User profiles

### Preserved Services
- `canvasService.js` - Canvas CRUD operations
- `elementService.js` - Element management
- `profileService.js` - User profile management
- `realtime.js` - Element synchronization and chat (presence functions removed)

## Impact Assessment

### Removed Features
- ❌ Real-time user presence indicators
- ❌ Active user count and status
- ❌ User cursor tracking
- ❌ Room capacity limits (4 users max)
- ❌ User color assignments
- ❌ Connection status monitoring
- ❌ Heartbeat presence maintenance
- ❌ Join/leave room notifications

### Maintained Features
- ✅ Real-time canvas element synchronization
- ✅ Chat functionality
- ✅ User authentication and profiles
- ✅ Canvas creation and management
- ✅ Collaborative editing (elements)
- ✅ Permission-based access control

## Next Steps

### To Apply Changes to Existing Database
1. Run the migration script: `docs/sql/remove_presence_features.sql`
2. Verify that presence-related columns and functions are removed
3. Test that remaining functionality works correctly

### Code Cleanup Verification
1. Search codebase for any remaining presence references
2. Test canvas collaboration without presence features
3. Verify chat functionality still works
4. Ensure no broken imports or undefined references

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Reduced complexity in both frontend and backend
2. **Better Performance**: Fewer database operations and realtime subscriptions
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and debug
4. **Focused Features**: Core collaboration features remain intact
5. **Cleaner UI**: Simplified interface without presence indicators

The application now focuses on core collaborative editing features while maintaining real-time synchronization of canvas elements and chat functionality.
