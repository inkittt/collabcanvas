# Canvas Join Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows users to join other users' canvas rooms using invite codes, and ensures that joined canvases remain visible in the user's canvas history even after leaving the room.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Canvas Categorization System
**Files:** `src/services/canvasService.js`, `src/components/Canvas/CanvasDashboard.js`

**Features:**
- **My Canvases** - Canvases owned by the user (marked as `user_role: 'owner'`)
- **Joined** - Canvases where user is a collaborator (marked as `user_role: 'collaborator'`)
- **Public** - Public canvases user can access (marked as `user_role: 'public'`)
- Visual role badges on each canvas card
- Filter buttons to view specific categories
- Enhanced canvas information showing ownership details

### 2. Database Function: `join_canvas_with_invite_code`
**File:** `docs/sql/join_canvas_function.sql`

**Features:**
- Finds canvas by invite code
- Checks if user is already the owner (returns canvas ID)
- Checks if user is already a collaborator (returns canvas ID)
- Adds user as a 'viewer' collaborator if not already associated
- Handles duplicate join attempts gracefully
- Returns canvas ID on success, null on failure

**Database Changes:**
- Added `invite_code` column to `canvases` table (if not exists)
- Created unique index on `invite_code` for performance
- Added RPC function with proper security (SECURITY DEFINER)

### 3. Updated Canvas Service: `getUserCanvases()`
**File:** `src/services/canvasService.js`

**Enhanced to retrieve:**
1. **Owned canvases** - Canvases where user is the owner (marked as `user_role: 'owner'`)
2. **Collaborator canvases** - Canvases where user is a collaborator (marked as `user_role: 'collaborator'`) (NEW!)
3. **Public canvases** - Public canvases (marked as `user_role: 'public'`) (excluding duplicates)
4. **Local canvases** - Fallback for offline functionality

**Key improvements:**
- Added `user_role` field to distinguish canvas relationship
- Added query to fetch canvases through `canvas_collaborators` table
- Implemented deduplication to prevent duplicate canvases
- Maintains proper profile information for all canvas types
- Preserves existing local storage fallback functionality

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard UI
**File:** `src/components/Canvas/CanvasDashboard.js`

**New Features:**
- **Filter Buttons:** All, My Canvases, Joined, Public
- **Role Badges:** Visual indicators showing user's relationship to each canvas
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Owner** (Green badge) - Canvases you created
  - ðŸ”µ **Joined** (Blue badge) - Canvases you joined as collaborator
  - âšª **Public** (Grey badge) - Public canvases you can access
- **Enhanced Canvas Cards:** Show ownership information and role-specific details
- **Privacy Badges:** Separate indicators for public/private status

### 5. Database Migration Applied
The database function has been successfully applied to your Supabase project `collabcanvas2`.

## How It Works

### Joining a Canvas
1. User enters an invite code in the "Join Canvas" dialog
2. `CanvasService.joinCanvasByInviteCode()` calls the RPC function
3. Database function:
   - Finds the canvas with the invite code
   - Adds user as a collaborator (if not already associated)
   - Returns the canvas ID
4. Frontend navigates to the canvas and refreshes the canvas list

### Canvas History Persistence
1. When `getUserCanvases()` is called (on dashboard load)
2. The function now queries three sources:
   - Canvases owned by the user
   - Canvases where user is a collaborator (**NEW**)
   - Public canvases
3. All canvases are deduplicated and sorted by update time
4. Joined canvases appear in the user's canvas list permanently

## Testing

### Database Function Testing
âœ… **Tested successfully:**
- User joining a canvas with valid invite code
- User attempting to join the same canvas twice (no duplicates)
- Collaborator record creation with 'viewer' permission
- Canvas ID return on successful join

### Example Test Results
```sql
-- User 'afiqheykal02' successfully joined canvas with invite code '5YQD7O'
-- Canvas ID returned: 7e433f76-f98e-4388-a4a3-98a75006c0dd
-- Collaborator record created with 'viewer' permission
-- Subsequent join attempts return same canvas ID without duplicates
```

## User Experience

### Before Implementation
- User joins canvas via invite code
- User can access canvas while in the room
- **Canvas disappears from history when user leaves**
- No distinction between owned and joined canvases
- Difficult to find previously joined canvases

### After Implementation
- User joins canvas via invite code
- User can access canvas while in the room
- **Canvas remains in user's canvas history permanently**
- **Clear categorization with filter buttons:**
  - **"My Canvases"** - Shows only canvases you own
  - **"Joined"** - Shows only canvases you've joined as collaborator
  - **"Public"** - Shows public canvases you can access
  - **"All"** - Shows everything
- **Visual role indicators** on each canvas card
- **Enhanced canvas information** showing ownership details
- User can rejoin any canvas anytime from their dashboard

## Files Modified/Created

1. **`docs/sql/join_canvas_function.sql`** - New database function
2. **`src/services/canvasService.js`** - Updated getUserCanvases() method with role categorization
3. **`src/components/Canvas/CanvasDashboard.js`** - Enhanced UI with filters and role badges
4. **`test_canvas_join.html`** - Test file for manual verification
5. **`test_canvas_categories.js`** - Test script for categorization functionality
6. **`CANVAS_JOIN_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This documentation

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Open your CollabCanvas application
   - **Test Canvas Categorization:**
     - Check the new filter buttons: All, My Canvases, Joined, Public
     - Verify role badges appear on canvas cards (Owner/Joined/Public)
     - Test filtering functionality with each category
   - **Test Join Functionality:**
     - Create a new canvas and note its invite code
     - Use a different user account to join via invite code
     - Verify the canvas appears in the "Joined" category for the second user
     - Check that the canvas shows proper owner information
   - Test leaving and rejoining the canvas

2. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test with invalid invite codes
   - Test joining the same canvas multiple times
   - Test with different permission levels
   - Test canvas deletion and collaborator cleanup

## Security Considerations

- RPC function uses `SECURITY DEFINER` for proper permission handling
- Function validates invite codes before adding collaborators
- Existing RLS policies ensure users can only see canvases they have access to
- No sensitive data is exposed in the function

## Performance Considerations

- Added unique index on `invite_code` for fast lookups
- Deduplication logic prevents unnecessary data processing
- Queries are optimized to minimize database calls
- Existing indexes on `canvas_collaborators` support the new queries
