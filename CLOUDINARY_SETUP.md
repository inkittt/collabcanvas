REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Cloudinary Configuration
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here

REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Cloudinary credentials.

### Step 5: Restart Your Development Server

```

## ‚úÖ Testing the Integration

1. **Upload Test**: 
   - Open your canvas
   - Click the image upload button
   - Select an image file
   - Verify it uploads to Cloudinary and appears on canvas

2. **Real-time Test**:
   - Open the same canvas in two browser windows
   - Upload an image in one window
   - Verify it appears in both windows instantly

3. **Image Editor Test**:
   - Right-click on an uploaded image
   - Select "Advanced Edit"
   - Apply filters (brightness, contrast, etc.)
   - Click "Apply & Sync"
   - Verify changes appear in all windows

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Cloudinary is not configured" Error
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure you've restarted the development server
- Verify your cloud name and upload preset exist

### "Upload failed" Error
- Check your upload preset is set to "Unsigned"
- Verify the file size is under 10MB
- Ensure the file format is supported (jpg, png, gif, webp)

### Images Not Syncing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase real-time is working
- Ensure both users are on the same canvas

### Slow Image Loading
- Images are served from Cloudinary's CDN, so they should be fast
- Check your internet connection
- Large images may take a moment to process transformations

## üìä Cloudinary Dashboard

Monitor your usage in the Cloudinary dashboard:
- **Media Library**: View all uploaded images
- **Usage**: Track bandwidth and storage
- **Transformations**: See which effects are being used

## üîí Security Notes

- The upload preset is unsigned for simplicity
- For production, consider using signed uploads
- Images are public by default (suitable for collaborative canvases)
- Consider adding folder organization for different canvases

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once basic integration is working, you can:
1. Add more artistic filters
2. Implement smart cropping with face detection
3. Add image optimization settings
4. Create custom transformation presets
5. Add image analytics and insights

## üí° Tips

- **Performance**: Cloudinary automatically optimizes images for web delivery
- **Collaboration**: All transformations are URL-based, so they sync instantly
- **Storage**: Original images are stored in Cloudinary, only URLs in your database
- **Bandwidth**: Free tier includes 25GB/month bandwidth (generous for most projects)

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Cloudinary dashboard shows uploaded images
3. Test with different image formats and sizes
4. Check the network tab to see if API calls are successful

Happy collaborating! üé®‚ú®
